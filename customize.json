  "wishText": " Happy Valentine’s Day to the most incredible person I’ve ever known. Every single day with you feels like a dream, and I still can’t believe I get to call you mine. You are kindness in its purest form, sweetness in every way, and beauty beyond words. You’re not just beautiful on the outside but even more breathtaking within. Your heart is full of love, warmth, and care, and I feel so lucky to be the one who gets to experience it all. You are the cutest, most adorable person I’ve ever met—every little thing you do makes my heart melt. Whether it’s the way you smile, the way you laugh, or just the way you look at me, I swear it’s the most perfect thing in the world. I could search the whole universe and still never find anyone as perfect as you. You make my world brighter, my heart happier, and my life so much more beautiful. Thank you for being you—just the way you are—because that’s the version of you I love the most. I love you endlessly, today and always. Happy Valentine’s Day, my perfect girl. ❤️",
